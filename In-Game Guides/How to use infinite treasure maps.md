# Ã˜zark Infinite Treasure Maps Guide


### How to use infinite treasure maps:
**How to get and collect treasure maps:**
- You get treasure maps every 5 level/ranks.
- You can collect your treasure maps from your mailbox in the Post Office or from your lockbox.

#### The actual guide:
1. Go into `Network > Account > Treasure [RISK]` and enable "Infinite Treasure Maps".
2. Then you're going in your inventory and select a treasure map.
3. Teleport near the location of the treasure, then go into "Treasure Finder" (Location in the menu: 'World > Treasure Finder > "treasure names here"'), select the treasure in the menu and press "Teleport To Chest".
4. After you finished looting, just teleport a bit away from the treasure (not too far, but also not too close).
5. Go back to you inventory, you'll see that you still have the treasure map that you originally used.
6. Now you can just repeat everything you did so far (Step 2. till step 4.).
Note: It's not recommended to get over a 100 gold, with infinite treasure maps, per 24 hours (irl-time).
