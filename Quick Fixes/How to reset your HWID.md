Note: You can reset your HWID once every 7 days, if you want to reset your HWID and don't want to wait till the cooldown is over, you can [DM SiNNER#1337 on Discord](https://discord.com/users/218469630010851329) and pay a small fee of 5$ (USD) to have it manually resetted. This fee is nonnegotiable, if you don't want to pay the fee then wait till your 7 day cool down is over.
